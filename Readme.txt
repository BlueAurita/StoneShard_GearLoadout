[To Use]

You only need the StoneShard_GearLoadout.exe file to run the simulator.


[Controls]

Clicking an equipment slot at the top right will open an equipment table on the left.

Clicking an item in the equipment table equips it.

Right-clicking an equipped slot will unequip the item.

The total stats of equipped items are displayed in the four fields below the equipment slots.

The resistances by body part of equipped gear are displayed in the four fields to the right of the equipment slots.


[Not Implemented Yet]

Penalties for dual-wielding weapons (e.g., Main/Off-hand efficiency, cooldown reduction, Accuracy, Fumble, etc.)

Dual-wielded weapon stats are simply added together. (e.g., Armor Penetration +20% from Main hand and +20% from Off hand results in 40%)

Equipment enchantments and curses

Sorting by clicking the table headers (Tier, Class, Price, etc.) works in ascending/descending order, but may cause selection errors.



[Other Notes]

All equipment stats are based on the official Stoneshard Wiki.

This Stoneshard equipment simulator was developed using Python and PyQt5 on Windows OS. Since the developer is still inexperienced with coding, it may not function properly on Linux or macOS.


[Things I’d Like to Add]

Add an enchantment tab that appears in the left panel (where the item table is currently shown) via a button placed between the equipment slots and the stat display.

Improve Text Readability Without Expanding Window Size (done)
Find a way to improve text readability without increasing the overall window dimensions.
