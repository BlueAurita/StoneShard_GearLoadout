[Controls]

Clicking an equipment slot at the top right will open an equipment table on the left.

Clicking an item in the equipment table equips it.

Right-clicking an equipped slot will unequip the item.

The total stats of equipped items are displayed in the four fields below the equipment slots.

The resistances by body part of equipped gear are displayed in the four fields to the right of the equipment slots.

[Other Notes]

All equipment stats are based on the official Stoneshard Wiki.

This Stoneshard equipment simulator was developed using Python and PyQt5 on Windows OS. Since the developer is still inexperienced with coding, it may not function properly on Linux or macOS.
